Review about existing code:

1. Every test case is initializing new driver instance. This will add more time to the total execution time of test cases.
2. There was no modular structure to the porject.
3. Data is not being passed from once place.
4. Repeated code in test case eg. setDriverpath()
5. Inconsistency in the way elements were being declared.
6. PageFactory method was not declared.
7. report was not generated.
8. Using Thread.sleep is not something that should be followed according to the WebAutomation standards
9. There is no Page Object Model pattern followed

Current Changes made:
1.  Modular structure
2.  WebDriverfactory will handle the browser initialization. It binds the instance with current thread and that how the 
    SINGLE instance of driver is maintained.
3.  BASE class will contain the base selenium methods.
4.  Hooks File have the @BeforeSuit, @AfterSuit configurations
5.  There is a class called PAGEINSTANCES that handles the class instances of webpages.
    This is LAZY initialization pattern in 7 singleton patters
6.  Test Cases will only have calling methods from respective Webpages.
7.  Test-output folder had the report generated
8.  The screenshot in reports are shown if test case fails.
9.  To run test either run the testng.xml file or "mvn clean test -P runTestsLocally" command from command prompt
10. The utility package has separate Clases handling the WEBDRIVER WAIT methods.
11. The apache Log4j will gemerate a log file ClearTrip.log to store all the steps executed and also the failure occuring
